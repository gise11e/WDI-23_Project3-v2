First few days were mostly spent on getting the hardest functonality up and running.

This consisted of:

 - What MVP state do we want to go for?
 - What would it look like on screen

Challenges

- Sendgrid-  api key left in github forcing temporary shutdown of email functionality
- etsy/amazon integration
- Epic email integration function
